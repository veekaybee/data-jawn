	"As Apollo 11's Lunar Module descended toward the moon under automatic control, a program alarm in the guidance computer's software nearly caused a mission abort. Neil Armstrong responded by switching off the automatic mode and taking direct control."

	+ "HOW GRUBHUB ANALYZED 4,000 DISHES TO PREDICT YOUR NEXT ORDER" 
	+ "In the parlance of a data scientists, food is an unstructured domain. Grubhub had 14 million menu items and the only thing they had in common was that sometimes people ate them. So Belousova’s team set out to build its own taxonomy of food."
 	+ Schreiber created a cuisine dictionary for the data team that broke down the ingredients in many of the dishes, an internal document that included names of cuisines, history, sometimes maps to show the geographic relationships. She built decks to explain to the data scientists dishes that didn’t have obvious names.

# The reality: 

+ We still [don't have enough data](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/training-self-driving-vehicles-challenge-scale/
)
```
50 epochs * 104 TB of data / 19 MB/s = 9.1 years to train an Inception-v3-like network once.
6.2 years for a ResNet-50-like network.
1.2 years for an AlexNet-like network.

# [fit] Problem: :cloud: Moving and working with Data to the Cloud:cloud:

1. You've been doing great 

Business ask: 

Steps work backwards   

 + 3/4 of my last clients have involved at least some cloud movement component
+ 100 % of those have involved ETL moves 
+ the average time before respondents thought their IT budgets would be 80% cloud-based 
was 15 months[http://usdatavault.com/library/Building-Trust-in-a-Cloudy-Sky.pdf]

+ 41% of workloads are run in the cloud
+ [Cloud computing spending](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/04/29/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-2017/#3b5c01fc31e8
) is growing at 4.5 times the rate of IT spending since 2009 and is expected to grow at better than 6 times the rate of IT spending from 2015 through 2020.
+ But all of the data is still in Oracle

Examples of problems moving to the cloud

+ Schema migration
+ Metadata migration
+ Estimating costs
+ Analysts now become developers
+ Skills shortage
